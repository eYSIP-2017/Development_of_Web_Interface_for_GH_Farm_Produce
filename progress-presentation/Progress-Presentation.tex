\section{Overview of Project}
\begin{frame}{Overview of Project}
    Development of GH farm-produce web monitoring System \\
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Objective: \\
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item To design a web portal to be used for monitoring and  keeping a record of vegetable produce in  the greenhouse.
            \item To establish communication between the weighing machine and a server and save pre-defined characteristics of the vegetables like quantity(according to the weight), its image etc in the database and update the same on the web portal.
        \end{enumerate}
        \item Deliverables:\\
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Creating User and Developer manual.
            \item Report and Presentation
        \end{enumerate}

\section{Task Accomplished}
\begin{frame}{Task Accomplished}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Establishing communication between raspberry pi and server and inserting data into the database
        \item Designing database schema for the project
        \item Developing login page for different users (Admin,Consumer,Producer)
        \item Showing produce log with images for each producer
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Challenges Faced}
\begin{frame}{Challenges Faced}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Django architecture: \\Django is based on the Model-View-Controller(MVC) architecture. Since we have never worked with it before it took time to understand the architecture and how to set up our project with it to make optimum use of the architecture. 
        \item Communication between raspberry pi and Server:\\We earlier used tcp socket server for communication which had the drawback of deadlock condition. We changed the entire architecture of the client-server communication to make use of the better RESTful API. This solved the problems we had about of having to run two servers, since Django supports REST API. This has also made the communication free from deadlocks and also the code can now be easily changed to communicate with any other server.
    \end{itemize}

\section{Future Plans}
\begin{frame}{Future Plans}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Develop web interface to provide consumer the option to add items to cart and purchase products currently available.
        \item Creating reports in form of charts which describe different statistics and analytics.
        \item Adding notification feature for new farm produce and orders.
        \item Setting Up the website on an actual server.
    \end{itemize}
